## Projects:
Here are some of the projects I have participated in across various courses:

### Project 1: [TFG-PFC](https://github.com/pablofc18/TFG-PabloFC)
- **Course:** TFG (Trabajo de Fin de Grado)
- **Description:** In this repository we can find the additional material used for the creation of the project.
- **My Contributions:** Everything is done by me.

### Project 2: [HoneyFlow](https://github.com/pablofc18/Honeyflow)
- **Course:** PTI (Proyecto de Tecnolog√≠as de la Informaci√≥n)
- **Description:** A platform that leverages various honeypots created by the community, adapted in our own Docker containers. We expose these honeypots to detect and analyze attacks. Additionally, we use multiple Python scripts to perform attacks. The collected information is then displayed on a web application created with Flask. We also scalate the honeypots with Kubernetes.
- **My Contributions:** I performed the attack scripts, contributed to the development of the web and some other functions and scripts we needed to make everything work.

### Project 3: [Keyboard Designer](https://github.com/pablofc18/Keyboard-Designer-PROP-FIB)
- **Course:** PROP (Proyectos de Programaci√≥n)
- **Description:** Program coded in Java that designs the optimal keyboard layout for single-finger typing, based on given input.
- **My Contributions:** I participated in the manipulation of input data, modifying it to fit our data structures. I also handled exceptions that could arise from various errors, and contributed to the development of several views for the program's graphical user interface.
